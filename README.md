# AI PDF Extractor

AI PDF Extractor is an AI-powered application designed to help you extract valuable information and insights from your PDF documents. Upload any PDF, ask questions about its content, and receive accurate answers generated by a sophisticated language model.

## Core Features

-   **PDF Upload**: Easily upload PDF files to the application.
-   **PDF Display**: View the content of your uploaded PDFs directly in the browser.
-   **AI-Powered Question Answering**: Ask natural language questions about the PDF content and get intelligent answers from our AI.

## Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: Next.js (React Framework), TypeScript
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI components
-   **AI Backend**: Genkit (using Google's Gemini model via existing flows)
-   **Deployment**: Vercel, Netlify, or any platform supporting Next.js.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (version 18.x or higher recommended)
-   npm or yarn

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd ai-pdf-extractor
    ```
    (Replace `<your-repository-url>` with the actual URL of this project, and `ai-pdf-extractor` with the project directory name if different)

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    The AI flows in this application might require API keys for services like Google AI Studio (for Gemini). Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add any necessary environment variables. For example, if using Google's Gemini models directly via Genkit:
    ```env
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY
    ```
    The current AI flows (`src/ai/flows/*`) are pre-configured and should work if the Genkit setup with Google AI is correctly established (as per `src/ai/genkit.ts` and `src/ai/dev.ts`).

4.  **Run the development server:**
    To start the Next.js application:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will typically start the application on `http://localhost:9002`.

5.  **Run Genkit (for AI flow development/testing - optional for just running the app if flows are deployed):**
    If you need to run or test the Genkit flows locally:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
    This starts the Genkit development server, usually on a different port (e.g., `http://localhost:3100`).

### Usage

1.  Open the application in your web browser (e.g., `http://localhost:9002`).
2.  Click the "Upload PDF" (or "Change PDF") button to select a PDF file from your computer.
3.  Once uploaded, the PDF content will be displayed in the left-hand panel (Document Viewer).
4.  In the right-hand panel ("Ask Your Document"), type your question related to the PDF's content into the text area.
5.  Click the "Ask Question" button.
6.  The AI will process your question and the PDF content, and the answer will appear in the "AI Answer" section.

## Deployment

This Next.js application can be easily deployed to platforms like Vercel or Netlify.

### Deploying to Vercel:

1.  Push your code to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
2.  Sign up or log in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
3.  Create a new project and connect it to your Git repository.
4.  Vercel will automatically detect that it's a Next.js project and configure the build settings.
5.  Add any necessary environment variables (like `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) in the Vercel project settings.
6.  Deploy!
